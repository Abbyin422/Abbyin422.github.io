I am Yabin Yin (尹雅彬), a PhD candidate in [the Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/node/534) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

My research interests are in the fields of **development economics** and **political economy**. My current works focus on the gender inequality in developing regions, and the dynamics between political elites and the society in non-democratic regimes.  

You can find my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0hxmttjbv45marpjaisfo/CV_YIN_Yabin.pdf?rlkey=6pggrhfvt6ufsha8x9h6vlm5r&dl=0) here.
